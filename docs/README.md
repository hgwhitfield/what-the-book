With the scope for future enhancements, the platform aims to grow and adapt to the evolving needs of its users, making it a valuable tool for book lovers everywhere.

## UX Design Documentation

### 1. Introduction

The primary goal of the UX design process for **"What the Book"** was to create a simple, intuitive, and engaging web application that allows users to discover, explore, and organize their next great reads. The vision was to provide a seamless experience where book lovers could manage their To Be Read (TBR) lists efficiently, eliminating the need for notes on their phones or scattered lists. The web app was designed to be scalable, with the potential to evolve into a standalone application in the future.

### 2. Research and Planning

The research phase involved understanding the needs and preferences of book enthusiasts. We conducted surveys and interviews with potential users, which provided insights into their reading habits and how they currently manage their TBR lists. Analyzing competitor websites and apps helped us identify common features and areas for improvement. The planning phase focused on defining the core functionalities and ensuring that the design would be user-centric and adaptable for future enhancements.

### 3. Wireframes

Wireframes were created to outline the basic structure and layout of the website. These wireframes focused on the placement of key elements such as the search bar, book results, and the TBR list. The goal was to ensure a logical flow of information and ease of navigation. Wireframes also helped in visualizing the user journey from discovering a book to adding it to the TBR list.

The mock-ups were used to gather feedback from stakeholders and users, allowing us to iterate and refine the design.

**Example Mock-up:**
